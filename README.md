# Welcome to the source code of [camalia.co.za](https://camalia.co.za). 

This is a small antiques website that I am developing for a friend. The front end runs mostly on React, along with Bulma for styling. Also see the Strapi [backend](https://github.com/abrigrobler/cam-backend) here. The front end is hosted on [Afrihost](https://afrihost.co.za), and the back end is hosted on [Render](www.render.com), with media on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com).
